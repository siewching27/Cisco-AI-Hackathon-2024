On 30th October 2024, we were excited to be shortlisted for the competition. After attending a two-day briefing session, we were required to enroll in an AI course, which allowed us to earn a professional certificate from IBM in AI technology. With the knowledge gained from the course, we applied it to our project, enhancing our prototype for additional marks.

Finally, on 15th December 2024, we were thrilled to be announced as one of the finalists, securing our spot at the award ceremony.

<h3>💡Reflection</h3>
I am truly glad that I pushed myself to participate in this professional competition. At first, we were overwhelmed with our upcoming tests and nearly considered giving up. However, thanks to our dedicated group leader, who guided us through discussions, we stayed committed. Despite the challenges, we managed to develop an idea, build a prototype, and complete our video presentation— even at the last minute.

I am also deeply grateful to my teammates for their dedication to this project. Their time, effort, and knowledge played a crucial role in making our project a success.

Through this experience, I have learned the importance of participating in more competitions like this. Not only does it help us gain valuable knowledge, but it also enhances our opportunities for the future. Earning a professional IBM certificate in AI technology through the course was an added bonus, further strengthening our expertise and credentials.<br><br>
